# Meals On Wheels

Meals on Wheels is a social services organization that distributes meals every business day to seniors and people with disabilities to address senior hunger and isolation. TPEO has partnered with the Meals on Wheels branch in Travis County (which consists of ~18 senior centers total) to improve the efficiency of the organization’s senior sign-up process and the senior’s daily sign-in process. The current sign-up process involves a 20-30 minute in-person application with each Center Coordinator. The information collected consists of the following:

- Age
- Demographics
- Income
- Food Allergies
- Nutrition Education
- Veteran Status
- Code of Conduct (extensive form)
- Media Release (extensive form)
- Disability Classification
    
The daily sign-in process involves seniors signing sign-in sheets in-person at each center. Every week, one person is responsible for bringing back sign-up/sign-in information to the central office.

- Paperwork coming in from 18 centers per week is implied to be difficult for Central Office to process
- Less funding has been implied by not meeting paperwork exchange deadlines
